This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and you are trying to render a component that does not support the key prop. The key prop is essential for FlatList to efficiently update and render items. If you don't provide a unique key for each item, FlatList might not be able to track changes properly, leading to incorrect rendering or unexpected behavior. This can manifest as missing items, duplicated items, or items being rendered in the wrong order.
